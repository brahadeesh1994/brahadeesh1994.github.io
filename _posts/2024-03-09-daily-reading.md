By way of breathing life into this blog, I've resolved to make a post every day which summarizes what I've read that day.
My library of physical books has now filled into four bookshelves, and I'm really excited to dig into the pages that are awaiting my attention!
Hopefully, by logging my reading activity in this manner I will be inspired to really keep at it, instead of just doomscrolling on social media (ugh!).

I bought a copy of Charles Loewner's [*Theory of Continuous Groups*: Notes by Harley Flanders and Murray H. Potter][Loewner] at a book fair organized by IIT Bombay's Central Library a few months ago.
Having read a chapter and a half so far, it seems like a lovely introduction to representation theory.

Just for a bit of background, the first (and only) course on representation theory that I took was in the final semester of the BS-MS programme at IISER Bhopal, and at that time we had followed Benjamin Steinberg's [*Representation Theory of Finite Groups*: An introductory approach][Steinberg].
Somehow, I didn't understand the subject well (my transcript says I was awarded a B, but that's probably generous).
Everything just seemed far too slick for my taste.
I gave it another shot when I entered the Ph.D. programme at IIT Bombay, but Serge Lang's [*Algebra*][Lang] was of no help.
It was only much later, towards the end of my Ph.D., that I realized that I was looking for a combinatorial view of representation theory.
So, I immediately picked up Bruce Sagan's [*The Symmetric Group*: Representations, combinatorial algorithms, and symmetric functions][Sagan], but it turned out that I wasn't ready for a graduate level textbook.

So, Loewner's notes, organized as 14 lectures in just over a hundred pages, seemed very enticing.
Here is its table of contents:

The flavor of the lectures is very different from the other books I've read, perhaps because the terminology and style is antiquated.
The category theoretical style is the modern one, I believe, and for many good reasons.
But, if it's computation that I need, then I'll take it in whichever flavor it comes; category theory can wait!

After these fourteen lectures, perhaps Amritanshu Prasad's [*Representation Theory*: A combinatorial viewpoint][Prasad] can be my second course.

***

The approach of working with *concrete* groups (called *transformation groups* in Loewner) as opposed to *abstract* groups, brought to my mind two things.

The first, a conversation I had not too long ago with [Arusha], on how the *action* of a group feels more fundamental than its axiomatic definition.
In particular, I wondered whether there was a way to place group actions more prominently in a first course on group theory.
Loewner's notes seem to indicate that this was probably the preferred viewpoint when concrete groups were the more important objects of interest, rather than abstract groups.
So, if the axiomatic definition of a group is given centre-stage today, it's most probably because of the advantages offered by the abstraction.
Then, one shouldn't try to swing too far back into the old ways, but should instead strive for an appropriate balance.

This led to the second thought, a memory of Israel Herstein's [*Topics in Algebra*][Herstein] that I first read during the summer at the end of my first year at IISER Bhopal.
My vague impression is that the book took a very computational approach to group theory.
Skimming through my copy of the book now, I'm firstly amazed at the depth and breadth of the topics covered in so few pages.
And there are so many places where Herstein offers multiple proofs of the same result!
Secondly, the book also shows how one can balance a computational outlook with an abstract approach.
There is just so much to learn from this *introductory* textbook.
I seem to have read only the first few chapters, since I haven't made any marginal notes on the chapter on Field Theory and any of the later ones.
Now I'm dying to give the entire book a thorough read!
This may even be a good opportunity to go through [Prahlad Vaidyanathan][Prahlad]'s revised Indian edition of Herstein's textbook.
It was a pleasure to learn from Prahlad at IISER Bhopal, though I only got the opportunity twice: Calculus 101 in the very first semester, and... representation theory in the final one, haha!

So much to read, so little time...
