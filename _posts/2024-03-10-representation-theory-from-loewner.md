One of the things I find delightful about my mathematics and music is that one can immerse oneself in any one aspect and continuously discover new facets of it that had mysteriously escaped notice until then.
Three chapters into Loewner's [book][1] (see the [previous post][2] for my first thoughts) and I can hardly stop beaming, because I am experiencing this phenomenon once again.
It takes some effort to adjust to the style of exposition, but it is worth it.
It's completely clear that I had never grasped how to think about a group representation, because no one had shown me the bare calculations and geometry underlying the formalisms, and I didn't have the maturity to work it all out myself.

One of these days, after sufficient time and reflection, I'll try to write about specific perspectives from Loewner that I found to be helpful, and contrast them with modern expositions.
So far, Loewner has defined a group representation, shown how to construct the sum and product of representations, and classified the irreducible representations of cyclic groups, finite abelian groups, and compact abelian groups.
Next, he's going to look at representations of a general finite group.
In preparation of this, we've seen a proof of [Schur's lemma][3], and the construction of the [regular representation][4].
