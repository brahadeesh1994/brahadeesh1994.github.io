This is just a test post. Here is some inline math with dollars as delimiters: $e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0$. Here is some inline math with the LaTeX delimiters: \(e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0\).

Here is some displayed math with double dollars as delimiters (there's a newline in the plain text file right after this one ends):

$$
e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0.
$$

Here is some displayed math with the LaTeX delimiters:
\[
e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0.
\]
